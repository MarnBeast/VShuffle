# VShuffle
Python app allowing users to split video sources into clips and then play back those clips in a custom order / filtered by custom clip-types.

An evolution of the idea that inspired my Gatekeeper project.

## Installation
VShuffle depends on [moviepy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/) for the video editing and [kivy](https://kivy.org/) for the user interface. I've set up a setup.py and a requirements.txt for easy deployment. To install, run `pip install .` from the root directory.
